    <p>Brightcove Campaign provides the ability to create lead forms which allow you to capture viewer information during video playback. Forms give you the ability to include whatever fields you need (visible or hidden) and also give you the ability to take advantage of features like progressive profiling (if available). The lead data is sent to, and processed by, HubSpot. </p>

    <h2 id="form">Creating a form in HubSpot</h2>
    <p>HubSpot provides the ability to create forms that can be used to capture viewer information. The form HTML that is generated will be used when creating a lead form inside Brightcove Campaign. The data that is captured can then be used in customizing future communications. The steps below will create a simple form to capture first name, last name and email address. For complete details on HubSpot forms, see the <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/landing-page-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-a-form-for-your-landing-page">HubSpot documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="edit">Copying and editing the form embed code</h2>
    <p>To use the form inside of Brightcove Campaign, you will need to copy and edit the form embed code. Also, you may want to do some basic styling to the form. In the steps below, we will copy the form embed code to an HTML editor and then make some styling changes to the form.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>Share</strong> in the upper right of the page.</li>
      <li> Click <strong>Embed code</strong> and then <strong>Copy</strong> to copy the embed code to the clipboard.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="hubspot form embed code" src="/assets/images/admin/hubspot-copy-form-embed.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Paste the embed code into your HTML editor of choice.</li>
      <li>The embed code needs a small change so Brightcove Campaign knows to close the form when it is submitted. Locate the line that has <strong><code translate="No"> formId:</code></strong> Add a comma at the end of the line.</li>
      <li>Add this line below the <strong><code translate="No"> formId:</code></strong> line.
        <pre>
<code translate="No">onFormSubmit: bcLeadForm.submit</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>By default, when the form is displayed inside of a Brightcove Player, the form will display on a transparent background over the player. Add the following CSS to the embed code to change the background color to grey.<br />
        <code translate="No">&lt;style&gt;<br />
        body {<br />
        background-color: rgba(204,204,204,0.9);<br />
        margin: 0;<br />
        padding: 20px;<br />
        height: 100%;<br />
        }<br />
        &lt;/style&gt;</code></li>
